# A-Star-pathfinding

A* pathfinding for use across hexagonal tiles in the unity3d engine!

This is a continuation of my BreadthFirstSearch project where I replaced the BFS with A* as well as some other improvements such as camera movement and changing costs at runtime, I'm hoping to explore this further and add different types of pathfinding algorithms later on and present them in small, easy to use versions
